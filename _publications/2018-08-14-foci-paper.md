This paper examines different reasons for web inaccessibility. Prior work on accessibility mostly focuses on censorship by nation states. We look at three forms of server-side blocking: blocking visitors from the EU to avoid GDPR compliance, blocking based upon the visitorâ€™s country, and blocking due to security concerns. We argue that these and other forms of blocking warrant more research.
